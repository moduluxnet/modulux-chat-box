# Modulux Chat Box

A lightweight, privacy-friendly floating Q&A chat box for WordPress.

Modulux Chat Box helps visitors find answers first — before they contact you via WhatsApp or any other channel.

## Why this plugin exists

Most chat plugins:
- Open WhatsApp immediately
- Rely on third-party services
- Load heavy icon libraries or frameworks
- Track users without consent

Modulux Chat Box takes a different approach.

**Answer first. Contact second.**

Visitors are encouraged to read your predefined Q&As before messaging you.
